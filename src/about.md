# What's this?

This is like a "wiki" of sorts where I write down and document stuff I've found helpful from across the internet. The primary purpose of this is that I don't have to go a searching for the same things again if ever needed, like bookmarks, but a bit overkill. I will try to keep things in a way that other can follow along, but no promises.
